# ISI Mods Unbound

A 7 Days to Die (7D2D) mod that lets you install any mod on any thing. It also lets you stack mods and remove the restriction on installing similar mods at once allows you install similar mods at once.

Examples:

- Any Mod on Anything: Burning Shaft on a Knife, Full Auto on Armor
- Stackable Mods: Install 4 x Full Auto mods on an M60 Machine Gun... or a Chainsaw
- Mod Are No Longer Exclusionary: Using a Barrel Extender no longer prevents you from adding a Silencer.
- Install Full Auto and Drum Magazine mods in _armor_ so _every_ gun fires faster and has a larger magazine
- Stack attribute mods in the weapons or tools that need them

Please drop a comment if you find a fun combination (so others can try it out).

## Somewhat Bound

- Full Auto and Burst Trigger Mods cannot be installed on any type of Bow.
  - Bows could not be reloaded after a single shot, and eventually the game would crash and corrupt the save.
- Drone mods cannot be installed in Armor.
  - Attempting to put Drone mods in Armor interrupts the game, opening a console full of red errors.

## Other Notes

- Mods with no effect
  - Some mods do not do anything if installed on something it wasn't designed for.
  - Example: Installing a Motor Tool Tank Mod on a Motorcycle does not increase the size of the gas tank
- Stackable Effects
  - While the game will let you stack any mod, sometimes the actual effects do not stack
  - Stacks: Full Auto Mods, Pocket Mods, Attribute Mods, etc.,
  - Does not stack: Impact Bracing Mod
